# DMildew

A scripting language for the D programming language inspired by Lua and JavaScript.

This is still very much a work in progress.

## Usage

The examples folder contains example scripts. It should look familiar to anyone who 
knows JavaScript. However, Mildew is not a full feature JavaScript implementation.

## Caveats

Unlike JavaScript, arrays in Mildew are primitives and can be concatenated with the '+'
operator. It is not possible to reassign the length property of an array.
